Hi, Kofkof here!
Recently i made an inventory (Escape From Tarkov Style) but since i stop looking at this project i have been thinking release it in this forum. So here i am with an another lost project. 

**WARNING**
I dont give any type of support to this script, so you are at your own! You are allowed to make any change to the script but you need to keep the name of the script with my name!

**What Is Standalone Adaptable?**
It means you can adapt to any framework out there, you just need to connect the use, give, drop events to my scripts like i did to the esx one!

**How do I install it correctly?**
- First insert the sql file to your server database and then go to the users table (if you dont have one, create it!) and add a collumn called 'items' and it is a LongText, the deafault value is [ ]; Like this image: ![image|690x22](upload://48QomUWTmH8lczRpWWbJDQVo9gR.png)  
- Place the kofkof_onthebanks folder in your resource server folder;
- Start the script on your server.cfg file;
- And have fun!

**Why this inventory is diferent from others?**
Because in this inventory you have:
 - Slots with different sizes, like 1x2 or 2x2 or even 2x7 (column x row);
 - It can have multiple inventories oppened at the same time;
 - Easy way to change items between inventories;
 - It has a unique damage system;
 - it works with almost every resolution out there!
